								<h2>Tfl Santandar Bike Analysis Calendar Heat Plot</h2>
								<hr>
							</header>

							<p>
								Analysis as part of my MSc thesis, "Using Spatio-temporal Analysis and Machine Learning to predict Transport for London bike sharing habits in the post COVID-19 era".
								<br>
								<br>
								Bike-sharing systems offer a convenient option to efficient and sustainable urban transportation,
								alleviating congestion. The growing demand necessitates continued understanding of how the systems
								are used. This study examines the shifts in Transport for London bike-sharing habits during the post
								COVID-19 era through exploratory and statistical analyses, focusing specifically on bike journeys
								undertaken in 2019 and 2022, totalling nearly 22 million rides.
								<br>
								<br>
								The calendar heatmap reveals how a larger proportion of bike journeys occur in the summer
								months. Anomalies are visible in both years, but are more pronounced during 2022, such as
								03/03/2022, 21/06/2022, 10/11/2022. On 10/11/2022 44,491 rides were recorded, whereas the
								average number of rides for all other days during November was 23,412. 
								<br>
								<br>
								September was one of two months in 2022 with fewer journeys than 2019. Noteworthy events, such as changes 
								in the Santander Cycles fare tariff and the death of Queen Elizabeth II, likely contributed to altered transport 
								habits and reduced bike usage during this month (TfL, 2022a; TfL, 2022b). These atypical events are difficult to 
								incorporate into predictive models. The results indicate days with the highest bike usage are heavily influenced 
								by TfL strikes across other forms of public transport. Notably, the top four days of bike usage in 2022 coincided 
								with strikes on the TfL Underground system. This highlights how disruptions in other modes of transportation can 
								impact the utilisation of BSSs. To strengthen these findings, future studies would benefit from analysing data from 
								additional years, with a particular focus on 2023 once the data is made available. This approach would enable more 
								robust and well-informed interpretations.
